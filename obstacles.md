Obstacles for me included:
  1.  Lack of a formalized filing structure from the start. While I do feel accomplished for having pieced together a working quiz, with database access, and Sass styling, and all of that, I spent a lot of time fiddling with the code in order to reach a point where everything functioned and talked to each other. I am pleased to have learned more about Docker, and npm, and Sass, and json packages; that being said, I still do not fully understand everything there is to know about Docker and how it works. I nearly broke my computer while I was messing around. Also, it would be more efficient, and would encourage the following of standard best practices if there was a formal structure to follow (e.g. /src/projects/kateQuizPlus/php... etc). There are three instructors, and, bless your hearts, you all seem to have a different idea of how to organize files, and then I have to backtrack. 
  2.  PHP connecting to the database was challenging; I definitely needed Chris's step-by-step. I find it very interesting working in PHP, and I think I'm excited to put it into practice again.
  3.  Style and positioning of elements on the page. Somehow it STILL seems to elude me when I want to move things around on the page. Next time maybe.
  4.  Personal frustration which never lasted that long, so really, I am fine.
