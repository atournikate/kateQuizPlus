In retrospect, I think it would have been good if I had a better understanding of how Docker works. It still seems shrouded in mystery to me, somehow just skirting around the edge of my understanding. That actually caused me the most anguish.
One thing I had reiterated and finally learned was how to read the error lines more carefully. Usually it ended up just being a misspelling or a dropped comma, but now errors don't concern me so much. I know how to tell if something is or is not working with var_dump and echos. 
It was fun putting together a quiz, and I think I would like to put my newfound skills into practice again, maybe do another one from scratch to see if I can understand it all.
